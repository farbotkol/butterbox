# Implementation progress

## Execution summary

- Total stories: **87**. Verified Done: **13**. In Progress: **8**.
  Blocked: **1**. Not started (Backlog): **65**.
- Done: BB-FOUND-002, BB-FOUND-003, BB-FOUND-004, BB-ORG-001, BB-ORG-003,
  BB-ORG-004, BB-PEOPLE-001, BB-PEOPLE-002, BB-PEOPLE-003, BB-PEOPLE-006,
  BB-ROSTER-001, BB-ROSTER-002 and BB-ROSTER-006.
- The latest serialized Node unit run passed 27 tests; the HTTP integration
  was explicitly skipped without disposable-project settings. The isolated SQL
  regression passed 388/388 pgTAP assertions through `psql`, including 78 draft-editing
  assertions and 28 linked-roster authorization assertions. The authenticated
  two-tenant HTTP regression and concurrent edit/edit, edit/create and
  edit/automatic-assignment checks passed against the disposable stack.
- Production compile, explicit TypeScript, generate and `npm run lint` passed.
  The complete production Chromium regression passed all 16 isolated scenarios,
  including signup/recovery, cross-tab expiry, five live permission transitions,
  both people stories, department/delegated management, weekly mobile roster,
  draft editing, historical timestamp preservation and the personal schedule.
- Redacted Gitleaks scan: current branch and pending tracked diff have no
  findings. The older local checkpoint-ref blocker described below remains
  unresolved; no credential values or checkpoint refs were modified.
- Earlier browser renderer/context failures and a signup runner process exit
  were observed under host memory pressure. Both full Chromium and headless
  shell were tried. The successful isolated-scenario run preserves each live
  permission transition and recovery-before-expiry coverage. Temporary app
  servers are stopped by the runner.

## Current story

- **BB-PEOPLE-004 — Submit availability exceptions** is in implementation:
  date blocks, leave requests and scoped manager review are being validated
  before availability rules are used for roster conflict detection.
- **BB-ROSTER-010 — Simple employee roster** now has a personal mobile schedule;
  it remains In Progress because required shift acknowledgements depend on the
  unfinished publication/versioning workflow.
- **BB-ROSTER-003 — Unassigned open shift** follows its availability/conflict
  prerequisites: assignment eligibility needs to be completed without
  changing the existing automatic-assignment-only role restriction.

### BB-ROSTER-001 — Weekly people-by-day roster (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ROSTER-001.1 Group by department; show venue-local dates, role and times | Grouped rows show each department's shifts, including visible historical assignments. A scoped roster lookup preserves employees' own secondary-department shifts without broadening management access. | Three grouping unit tests and 28 linked-roster SQL assertions pass. Authenticated requests to the standalone server verify grouped role/time/date markup, archived history and manager/employee scope. | Pass |
| ROSTER-001.2 Week navigation and responsive overflow | Week links retain the selected department; the grid has a horizontal mobile scroller. | Date/DST unit tests, authenticated next-week HTTP checks and production Chromium next/previous navigation and actual 375px horizontal scrolling pass. | Pass |

Files: `src/app/roster/page.tsx`, `src/lib/roster-groups.ts`,
`tests/roster-groups.test.mjs`, `tests/e2e/auth.spec.mjs`,
`supabase/migrations/20261101110000_linked_roster_departments.sql`,
`supabase/tests/database/linked_roster_departments.test.sql` and README.
The migration has been applied only to the disposable test database. It also
revokes own-shift access when membership is removed or no longer covers the
employee profile; managers do not acquire authority over personally linked
secondary departments.

### BB-ROSTER-002 — Create and edit shift (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ROSTER-002.1 Form supports venue, department, role, worker, dates, start/end and break | Permission-filtered venue selector and controlled create/edit form; scoped create/edit RPCs; venue-local time and DST handling. | Production Chromium creates and edits assigned and open drafts, checks all fields, changes venue and verifies the stored timezone. 78 isolated SQL assertions cover authorization, validation, DST and sub-minute timestamps; a separate production Chromium test verifies microseconds survive an unchanged-time edit. Pass. | Pass |
| ROSTER-002.2 Errors are inline | Form associates validation and server-side conflict errors with fields and retains input. | Production Chromium triggers missing role/start, invalid break and overlapping employee errors, verifies inline messages and preserved values. Pass. | Pass |
| ROSTER-002.3 Successful save updates grid | Revalidated roster and redirect preserve venue, department, week and collapsed state; creation form resets after success. Published shifts remain protected. | Production Chromium creates, edits and assigns shifts, verifies rendered cards, stored values, reset behavior and scope denial. Authenticated concurrent edit/create/auto-assignment HTTP cases pass. | Pass |

Files: `src/components/shift-editor.tsx`, `src/app/roster/page.tsx`,
`src/app/actions.ts`, `src/lib/shift-form.ts`, `src/lib/dates.ts`,
`src/lib/workspace.ts`, `src/lib/roster-view.ts`,
`supabase/migrations/20261101120000_edit_draft_shifts.sql`,
`supabase/migrations/20261101130000_consistent_shift_creation.sql`,
`supabase/tests/database/edit_draft_shifts.test.sql`,
`tests/shift-form.test.mjs`, `tests/dates.test.mjs`,
`tests/tenant-isolation.integration.test.mjs`, `tests/e2e/auth.spec.mjs`
and README. The migrations were applied only to the disposable test database.
Manual assignment currently checks active linked employees and overlap, not
restricted-role qualifications or availability.

### BB-ROSTER-010 — Simple employee roster (In Progress)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ROSTER-010.1 Only published assigned shifts appear | `/my-schedule` queries only scheduled, published shifts for employee profiles linked to the signed-in user and selected venue, with RLS still authoritative. | Production Chromium and authenticated Supabase requests verify own primary/secondary-department shifts, exclude drafts, unassigned shifts, other workers and another tenant; a manager with wider RLS still sees only their own personal shifts. Anonymous access and an unlinked account are also checked. Pass. | Pass |
| ROSTER-010.2 Venue-local time and location display clearly | Next-shift card and seven-day mobile schedule show venue-local dates/times, venue name/address and timezone; overnight overlaps appear in the week. | Three unit tests cover grouping, week boundaries and DST. Production Chromium at 375px verifies next shift, overnight overlap, local time, address, navigation and no page-level horizontal overflow. Pass. | Pass |
| ROSTER-010.3 Updates visible and acknowledged when required | Refresh fetches current published data; the UI explicitly states acknowledgements are not yet available. | Production Chromium publishes a draft through the scoped owner RPC and verifies it appears after refresh. Acknowledgement requirements and versioning are not implemented. | In Progress |

Files: `src/app/my-schedule/page.tsx`, `src/app/my-schedule/loading.tsx`,
`src/lib/employee-schedule.ts`, `tests/employee-schedule.test.mjs`,
`src/components/main-navigation.tsx`, `tests/e2e/auth.spec.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`
and README. TypeScript permits `.ts` import extensions so Node's native
type-stripping unit runner can load the shared date helpers without another
dependency. The new route uses existing RLS and adds no database migration.

### BB-ROSTER-006 — Filter and collapse departments (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ROSTER-006.1 FOH/BOH filtering and collapsing | Server-rendered, keyboard-operable department buttons use `aria-expanded` and hide their rows; the filter retains permitted departments. | Three state unit tests, authenticated HTTP requests and production Chromium verify filtering, collapse/expand buttons and independent groups. | Pass |
| ROSTER-006.2 Permission scope takes precedence | Collapse IDs are filtered against departments available to the caller; existing RLS and narrowly scoped personal-roster lookup limit underlying data and controls. | Linked-roster pgTAP suite and manager/employee HTTP checks pass, including forged collapsed IDs and denied secondary editing. | Pass |
| ROSTER-006.3 State persists while navigating | Week links, filter and disclosure forms, and shift/publish/delete redirects preserve the selected department and collapsed IDs. | Unit tests and authenticated HTTP checks verify week navigation, filtering and a successful shift save retain state. | Pass |

Files: `src/lib/roster-view.ts`, `tests/roster-view.test.mjs`,
`src/app/roster/page.tsx`, `src/app/actions.ts`, `tests/e2e/auth.spec.mjs`
and README. The targeted browser test passed collapse/expand, week/filter
navigation, shift save, forbidden IDs and manager/employee scopes.

### BB-PEOPLE-003 — Set recurring availability (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PEOPLE-003.1 Save multiple weekly intervals | Owner-controlled member/profile linking; employee-only `set_employee_recurring_availability` RPC; `/availability` editor; explicit distinction between an unsubmitted and an empty pattern. | 53 availability pgTAP assertions and production Chromium scenario save two Monday intervals, check persistence, deny other employees and exercise an empty week. Pass. | Pass |
| PEOPLE-003.2 Handle overnight intervals | Venue-local weekday/minute intervals interpret an end at or before the start as the next day; the roster computes cyclic weekly coverage. | pgTAP stores Sunday 22:00–02:00; unit tests verify overnight/week rollover and 24-hour ranges; production Chromium shows Sunday and Monday boundaries. Pass. | Pass |
| PEOPLE-003.3 Show unavailable periods | RLS-scoped roster indicators display the complement of saved intervals; unsubmitted availability is labelled unknown. | Production Chromium verifies Monday's three gaps, Tuesday's full-day unavailability, Sunday overnight coverage and a separate unsubmitted worker. Pass. | Pass |

Files: `20261101100000_recurring_availability.sql`,
`recurring_availability.test.sql`, `src/lib/availability.ts`, its unit test,
`src/app/availability/page.tsx`, `src/components/availability-editor.tsx`,
People, roster, navigation, workspace types, actions, README and browser tests.
The migration has been applied only to the disposable test database.
Only owners link existing members; invitations are not yet implemented.
Managers can view scoped availability but cannot edit it. Availability is an
indicator only and does not yet constrain shift assignments or leave.

### BB-PEOPLE-002 — Manage skills and eligible roles (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PEOPLE-002.1 Multiple roles per employee | Scoped `employee_job_roles` links, qualification editor and role filter. | 45-assertion eligibility pgTAP suite and production Chromium scenario save two roles and filter by a secondary role. Pass. | Pass |
| PEOPLE-002.2 Set a primary role | `set_employee_primary_role` and People primary-role form preserve exactly one structured primary role. | pgTAP and Chromium set and change a primary role, validate its profile title and prevent accidental removal. Pass. | Pass |
| PEOPLE-002.3 Exclude unqualified automatic assignments for restricted roles | Opt-in role restriction and `save_shift_auto_assign` validate role qualification and overlapping shifts under locks. | pgTAP and Chromium reject an unqualified employee, select a qualified employee and verify only one overlapping concurrent request succeeds. Pass. | Pass |

Files: `supabase/migrations/20261101090000_employee_role_eligibility.sql`,
`supabase/tests/database/employee_role_eligibility.test.sql`, `src/app/actions.ts`,
People, roster, organisation settings, `tests/e2e/auth.spec.mjs`, the browser
runner and README. The role migration has only been applied to the disposable
database. Existing free-text titles are not assumed to be verified
qualifications; automatic assignment does not check availability or leave.

The full current production-browser regression passed all 16 scenarios. Each
permission role transition has its own test process, retaining the previous
role, live signed-in session and scope assertions. Signup/recovery and
recovered-session expiry were separated while retaining real recovery before
the two-tab expiry check. Earlier renderer/context failures occurred under
host memory pressure; the cause was not established.

## Completed authentication and setup

### BB-FOUND-002 — Register and sign in (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 002.1 Verified accounts can authenticate | Signup uses the configured callback and exchanges confirmation codes. | Live Chromium with isolated Supabase/Mailpit verifies signup, emailed confirmation, login and redirect to setup. Pass. | Pass |
| 002.2 Wrong credentials have non-enumerating errors | Sign-in uses one generic error; reset uses generic confirmation. | Live browser compares unknown, unverified and wrong-password errors; unknown and registered reset responses match. Pass. | Pass |
| 002.3 Session expiry and logout work across tabs | Session-end notification and visibility refresh; sign-out failures are explicit. | Live browser checks cross-tab logout and a revoked expired session in two tabs. Pass. Expected invalid-refresh-token logs occur during expiry. | Pass |
| 002.4 Password reset completes | Recovery exchanges callback code, updates password, then signs out. | Real Mailpit link, password update, old-password denial and new-password login all pass. | Pass |

### BB-ORG-001 — Create business and first venue (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ORG-001.1 Setup collects business name, venue name, address and timezone | Setup UI/actions and `20261101040000_resumable_business_setup.sql`. | Isolated pgTAP verifies storage/validation; live browser submits all four fields and verifies stored address/timezone. Pass. | Pass |
| ORG-001.2 Ownership is established securely | Authenticated, serialized, atomic setup RPC. | pgTAP checks ownership, anonymous/repeated setup denial; live browser verifies owner membership. Pass. | Pass |
| ORG-001.3 Incomplete setup can be resumed | User-scoped RLS-protected persistent setup draft. | pgTAP checks isolation and cleanup; browser resumes partial setup in a separate context, including sample-data preference. Pass. | Pass |

The setup migration has been applied only to the disposable test database;
existing development and deployed databases still need the normal reviewed
migration process.

## Completed and verified

### BB-ORG-004 — Delegate departmental management (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ORG-004.1 Managers edit only assigned departments | Existing `can_manage_department` scoping on save/delete/publish; department-scoped roster filter; People shows linked staff from other departments as read-only. | pgTAP: FOH manager cannot add BOH shifts or publish BOH, and sees only FOH shifts; BOH manager likewise. Browser: each manager's filter lists only their department, a forced BOH URL falls back to FOH, BOH shift hidden from FOH manager, BOH manager cannot edit a FOH-primary profile. Pass. | Pass |
| ORG-004.2 Owner has consolidated view | All-departments roster labels each shift card with its department. | pgTAP: owner and venue GM see shifts in both departments. Browser: owner's all-departments view shows the BOH shift labelled "Back of House" plus the FOH open shift and combined counts. Pass. | Pass |
| ORG-004.3 Staff can belong to multiple departments | `20261101080000_multi_department_staff.sql`: `employee_departments` (backfilled; primary synced by trigger), owner/admin/GM `set_employee_departments` RPC, link-based `save_shift`, RLS for linked managers and own published shifts; shift FK relaxed to employee/business/venue. People membership form and roster linked staff. | pgTAP (25): primary auto-link, retained primary, venue/inactive/permission/cross-tenant denial, cross-department rostering and overlap detection, unlink keeps history. Browser: owner adds BOH, link stored, BOH manager rosters shared worker. Pass. | Pass |

Files: migration, `multi_department.test.sql`, `src/app/actions.ts`, People,
roster and `tests/e2e/auth.spec.mjs`. The shift-to-employee foreign key no
longer requires the shift department to equal the primary department;
`save_shift` enforces eligibility through the link table instead. Defects
fixed during testing: the old composite FK blocked secondary-department shifts,
and link-table RLS hid an employee's own secondary-department shifts. A
security-definer helper now handles that visibility check.

### BB-ORG-003 — Create departments and job roles (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ORG-003.1 FOH and BOH can be seeded | Existing `create_business` seeding, unchanged. | `department_roles.test.sql` asserts both departments and their roles are seeded for a new business. Pass. | Pass |
| ORG-003.2 Custom departments and roles can be created and deactivated | `20261101070000_department_role_management.sql`: `active` flags, `save_department`/`save_job_role` RPCs (owner/admin/GM for departments; department managers for their roles), duplicate/blank validation; `/settings/organisation` page, server actions, navigation link. | pgTAP covers create, rename, deactivate, reactivate, duplicates, cross-business/GM-venue/FOH-manager/employee/anonymous denial. Browser creates "Events", rejects a duplicate, adds and deactivates a role, renames and deactivates the department; employee page access denied. Pass. | Pass |
| ORG-003.3 Existing shifts retain historical references | Deactivation only flips flags; triggers block new shifts/active staff in inactive departments or roles while leaving existing rows; roster labels inactive departments and hides add-shift; People excludes inactive departments for new staff. | pgTAP verifies retained and renamed shift history plus new-shift/staff denial. Browser saves a shift through the UI, deactivates, and verifies the identical shift row, inactive roster notice and no add-shift or new-staff option. Pass. | Pass |

Files: migration, SQL test, `src/app/settings/organisation/page.tsx`,
`src/app/actions.ts`, roster, People, navigation and `tests/e2e/auth.spec.mjs`.
Fixed during testing: the inactive badge lacked a text separator, which gave
the heading the accessible name "FunctionsInactive". Shift roles are free text,
so inactive-role enforcement matches by name, case-insensitively. Publishing is
hidden for inactive departments.

### BB-PEOPLE-006 — View team directory (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PEOPLE-006.1 Search and filters work | People GET form, name search, venue/department/role/status filters; selections checked against accessible records. | Production browser searches case-insensitively and combines role/department/archive filters; active no-match and venue switching pass. | Pass |
| PEOPLE-006.2 Personal data restricted by role | Scoped database reads and manager-only page/action/navigation; no client-only authorization. | Browser verifies GM/FOH/BOH see only permitted worker profiles/venue options, rejects forbidden venue, and denies employee page access. Existing 50 permission pgTAP assertions and two-tenant HTTP regression pass. | Pass |
| PEOPLE-006.3 Inactive staff cannot be newly rostered by default | Archive flag, roster active filter and save_shift eligibility check. | SQL archive/new-shift denial and live browser archived-worker exclusion pass. Historical shift remains. | Pass |

Files: `src/app/people/page.tsx`, save action, extended browser test and README.
Latest standard `npm run build` passes, including TypeScript. All 8 unit tests,
lint, 128 SQL assertions, authenticated two-tenant HTTP regression and both
production browser scenarios pass (21.9s).

### BB-PEOPLE-001 — Maintain employee profiles (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PEOPLE-001.1 Name, preferred contact, employment type and status maintained | `20261101060000_employee_profiles.sql`, `src/app/people/page.tsx`, save action. | 18 new pgTAP assertions verify create/edit/archive/reactivate and normalized contact; live browser creates/edits/archives and verifies stored fields. Pass. | Pass |
| PEOPLE-001.2 Validation and tenant access enforced | Scoped RPC, existing RLS and immutable tenant association. | pgTAP rejects blank names, malformed email, invalid employment type, other tenant/department, employee and anonymous writes. Browser denies employee page/navigation. Pass. | Pass |
| PEOPLE-001.3 Archived staff history persists | Archive updates active flag only; no delete RPC, historical department preserved. | pgTAP and live browser retain original shift after archive; new assignment is denied in SQL and archived worker absent from roster dropdown. Pass. | Pass |

Profile migration applied only to disposable database. Added employee SQL test,
People page/navigation and server action; extended browser scenario. Latest
checks: lint and 8 unit tests pass; 128 SQL assertions pass; production
compile/typecheck/generate pass; both live browser scenarios pass (21.1s).

### BB-FOUND-004 — Business and venue permissions (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 004.1 Permissions scoped to business, venue and department | `20261101050000_scoped_membership_permissions.sql`, permission assignment RPC and `src/app/settings/permissions/page.tsx`. | 50 permission pgTAP assertions pass across two businesses/three venues; live browser assigns owner, GM, FOH, BOH and employee and verifies stored scopes and visible departments. | Pass |
| 004.2 Server denies unauthorized actions | Scoped RLS/RPCs, last-owner safeguard, owner-only assignment action/page. | pgTAP covers direct writes, self-promotion, wrong venue/department, outside business and anonymous denial. Browser denies nonowner page access. Pass. | Pass |
| 004.3 UI hides forbidden controls without relying on hiding for security | Role-gated navigation and roster controls; explicit filter submit. | Live browser verifies permission link only for owners and no employee save/publish controls; manager departments remain scoped. Server denial independently tested. Pass. | Pass |

Files changed for this slice: scoped migration and SQL test, workspace membership
selection, permissions page, actions, navigation/app shell, roster filter and
`tests/e2e/auth.spec.mjs`. Production compile, explicit TypeScript check and
generate phases pass. Both browser scenarios pass (23.3s).

### BB-FOUND-003 — Tenant isolation (Done)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 003.1 Tenant-owned records have an immutable business association | `supabase/migrations/20261101030000_immutable_business_associations.sql` guards all six business-scoped tables; user profiles are global identities, not business-owned records. | `tenant_isolation.test.sql` exercises every guard, including a previously movable membership and a same-business update. Six tests failed before the migration; all pass afterward. | Pass |
| 003.2 RLS and API reject cross-tenant reads and writes | Existing RLS and permission-checked RPCs plus immutable-ID triggers. | pgTAP tests reads, direct writes, RPC denial and valid own-tenant operations; `tests/tenant-isolation.integration.test.mjs` verifies authenticated HTTP reads and writes in both directions. Both pass. | Pass |
| 003.3 Automated tests cover two distinct businesses | `supabase/tests/database/tenant_isolation.test.sql`, `tests/tenant-isolation.integration.test.mjs`. | 32 new pgTAP assertions and one authenticated HTTP integration test pass with two businesses; the existing 9 pgTAP assertions also pass. | Pass |

The migration has been applied **only** to the disposable test database. Apply
it through the normal reviewed migration process before using it in another
environment. HTTP test fixtures were removed and their absence verified.

## Blocked stories

### BB-FOUND-001 — Create production-ready application (Blocked)

| Criterion | Implementation evidence | Test and actual result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 001.1 Clean checkout installs and builds with documented commands | `README.md`, lockfile and `Dockerfile`. | A separate clean checkout successfully ran `npm ci`, `npm test` and `npm run build`; the container also installed and built from scratch. | Pass |
| 001.2 Environment variables have safe examples | `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore` and `README.md`. | Example values are empty; a redacted Gitleaks scan of the clean checkout found no leaks. | Pass |
| 001.3 A deployment runs a health check | `src/app/api/health/route.ts`, `src/proxy.ts`, `Dockerfile` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. | A built container became healthy as UID 1000; `GET` returned 200 and `no-store`, `POST` returned 405, and the home page returned 200. | Pass |
| 001.4 No secrets are committed | `.gitignore` excludes local environment and Supabase CLI state. | Gitleaks found no leaks on the current branch or in the clean checkout. A scan of **all local refs** nevertheless found four Supabase key/token findings in an earlier local checkpoint commit, not reachable from the current branch. | Blocked |

Credential owners must assess/rotate any affected keys and decide how to handle
the local checkpoint history. This session did not rewrite or delete those
refs, and no secret values were printed. GitHub CI has been configured but has
not yet run remotely.

## Test environment and outcomes

- Supabase CLI 2.122.0 runs in a separate temporary project on ports
  55421/55422. The existing Butterbox stack was not modified. SQL fixtures are
  rolled back and HTTP fixtures are cleaned up. Following interrupted reset and
  migration attempts under host pressure, the disposable schema was restored
  transactionally with `psql`; later migration-history rows have empty
  `statements` arrays. A future normal reset should rebuild standard CLI history.
- Serialized Node unit run: 27 passed, one HTTP integration explicitly
  skipped without disposable settings. The isolated database regression
  passed 388/388 pgTAP assertions and the separately configured two-tenant
  HTTP integration passed with race cases.
- Production split compile, explicit TypeScript, generate and lint passed.
  All 16 production-browser scenarios passed in isolated processes, including
  signup/recovery and recovered-session expiry.
- The test helper rejects missing disposable confirmation and non-local URLs.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reported no production dependency vulnerabilities;
  `npm ci` reported 16 moderate development-dependency advisories.

## Outstanding defects and technical decisions

- The health endpoint is liveness only; it does not assert Supabase readiness.
- Build separate images per environment: Next.js embeds `NEXT_PUBLIC_` values
  at build time. Never use a secret/service-role key in those values.
- Stories are marked Done only after every acceptance criterion is verified.

## Next story

- Continue BB-ROSTER-003/007/008 and add the publication version and
  acknowledgement mechanism needed to complete BB-ROSTER-010.
- Migrations through `20261101130000` are applied only to the isolated stack.
  The pre-existing Butterbox development stack and production were not changed.
- Isolated workdir:
  `/home/codespace/.copilot/session-state/7476d757-d2b0-401f-90ff-d6ab4307efc9/files/butterbox-acceptance`.
  Next invocation can start its Supabase project again with the pinned CLI.
  Browser helpers create/remove fixtures and stop their app server automatically.
- Known environment workaround: sequential `--split-build` with
  `BUTTERBOX_TEST_LOW_MEMORY=yes`; use the existing session browser library
  directory in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` if Chromium reports missing system libraries.
  `BUTTERBOX_TEST_SUPABASE_CLI` accepts the cached native CLI path.
- No background execution or scheduling is promised after this session ends.
